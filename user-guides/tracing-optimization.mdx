Agentic AI is iterative. SketricGen lets you **edit → test → observe → improve** in one UI—so teams ship better workflows fast.

## The fast loop (all in one place)

1. **Edit** agent instructions, tool notes, handoff guidance, or structured output.
2. **Test** in the Playground for the current AgentSpace.
3. **Observe** in **Trace Explorer** (steps, tool I/O, durations, **credits**).
4. **Improve** and re-run; **Promote** when stable.

## Trace Explorer (what you see)

- **Agent steps & handoffs** (routing is chosen by agents based on instructions + input).
- **Tool inputs/outputs** (with redaction).
- **Durations & total latency**.
- **Credits per run**.
- Errors, retries, fallbacks.

## Testing tools

- **Snapshots**: save a good run as a baseline.
- **Diffs**: compare two runs (tool I/O, timings, structured output).

## Optimization quick wins

- Tighten **agent instructions**: when to call which tool; success criteria.
- Use **Agent as Tool** for repeatable sub-tasks (classification, extraction).
- Prefer **structured outputs** to cut parsing errors and retries.
- Configure **tool retries/fallbacks**; keep secrets in vault; redact sensitive fields.
- Cache heavy lookups where possible; reduce unnecessary tool calls.

## Post-deploy

- Watch **Insights** (usage, failures, latency).
- Duplicate winning spaces to evolve features without risk.
- Update widget copy (logo/colors/default & callouts) from the UI—no code redeploy.
