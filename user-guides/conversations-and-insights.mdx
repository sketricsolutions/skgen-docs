## Overview

The **Conversations** and **Insights** tabs provide a complete monitoring layer for your agents.

They help you **review, analyze, and optimize** performance by showing real user interactions, credit usage, and traffic distribution across platforms.

These two features together close the feedback loop, letting you trace how your agents perform in real-world deployments and how your overall account resources are utilized.

## Conversations

### Viewing Conversations

The **Conversations** tab lets you review all interactions across your deployed agents.

To view them:

1. Open **View Conversations** from the sidebar.
2. Select the **AgentSpace** or specific workflow you want to review.
3. A list of all recorded conversations for that AgentSpace appears.
4. Click on any conversation to open its full chat history.

Each conversation displays both user messages and agent responses exactly as they occurred, giving you a clear understanding of how your workflow behaves in production.

### Viewing Traces for Conversations

Within each conversation, you can open **detailed execution traces** for any message.

- Click the **View Traces** button next to an agent’s response.
- A detailed trace panel opens showing:
  - The **agents involved** in generating that response.
  - Any **handoffs** or **tool calls** executed.
  - The **time taken** and **credits consumed** for that message.
  - Structured input/output data for debugging.

This feature provides the same deep transparency available in the Playground — now extended to real, live conversations.

### Exporting Conversations

You can also **export conversations** for documentation, analysis, or training purposes.

Click the **Export** button at the top right of any conversation to download the full dialogue in JSON format.

**Use cases include:**

- Reviewing customer queries for workflow improvements.
- Sharing examples with team members.
- Fine-tuning your agents’ prompts or tool configurations.

## Insights

### Overview

The **Insights** tab helps you track and analyze how your account and agents are performing.

It includes two main views: **Account Overview** and **Agent Analytics**.

### Account Overview

This section summarizes key metrics for your account:

| Metric                  | Description                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Credit Usage**        | Shows how many of your allocated credits have been consumed.           |
| **Agent Capacity**      | Displays how many agent slots are currently being used.                |
| **Active Agents**       | Indicates how many of your agents are live and responding.             |
| **Estimated Days Left** | Calculates how long your credits will last at your current usage rate. |

You’ll also see a **Credits Overview** panel showing:

- Total credits used and remaining.
- Your monthly credit allocation.
- Visual credit utilization charts.

This gives administrators and teams a clear picture of account health and usage patterns.

You can also view the credits consumption by hovering on your Profile

### Agent Analytics

The **Agent Analytics** view provides performance insights for individual agents or AgentSpaces.

You can select any workflow to view its usage metrics.

Each analytics dashboard includes:

- **Total Messages** — Number of messages processed.
- **Conversations** — Total unique conversations handled.
- **Credits Used** — Credits consumed by that agent or workflow.
- **Last Active** — Timestamp of most recent activity.
- **Activity Timeline** — Message and credit usage trends across the past few days or weeks.

### Platform Distribution

When agents are deployed across multiple channels, you can track where your users engage most.

- **Usage by Platform:** Breakdown of traffic across connected apps and integrations (e.g., WhatsApp, Shopify, Slack).
- **Platform Performance:** Credit and message consumption per platform.

This helps you identify which deployment channels bring the highest engagement or cost and where optimization efforts should focus.

## How Conversations and Insights Work Together

- **Conversations** let you drill down into the _quality_ and _content_ of agent interactions.
- **Insights** provide a _quantitative overview_ of performance and resource utilization.
  Combined, they give you full operational visibility — from individual message traces to system-wide analytics.

## Best Practices

- Review **Conversations** weekly to identify recurring user queries or misunderstood intents.
- Monitor **Insights** regularly to track credit efficiency and agent utilization.
- Use **Agent Analytics** to identify high-performing workflows or underused tools.
- Compare **Platform Distribution** metrics to refine your deployment strategy.
- Export key conversations for retraining or documentation when refining prompts.
