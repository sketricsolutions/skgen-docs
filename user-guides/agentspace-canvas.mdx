## Overview

The AgentSpace is the central workspace of SketricGen: A visual canvas where you design, test, and optimize multi-agent workflows.

Each workflow is made up of agents, tools, and handoffs, connected through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

## Key Elements of the AgentSpace

### Agents (Nodes)

Each agent on the canvas represents a specialized role.

Agents handle reasoning, communication, or actions depending on their configuration.

**Common actions:**

- Add a new agent node using the **“+ Add Handoff Agent”** button.
- Configure its instructions, model, and attached tools.
- Duplicate or delete using the node toolbar.

**Pro Tip:**

Start with two agents — one primary “Coordinator” and one “Responder” — to get familiar with agent-to-agent handoffs before scaling.

### Tools (Attached Capabilities)

Each agent can be equipped with tools that let it act, compute, or fetch data.

Attached tools appear directly on the agent node, giving a quick view of its capabilities.

**Examples:**

- Attach **File Search** to give the agent access to a knowledge base.
- Add **API Request** for system integrations.
- Use **Code Interpreter** for internal computations.

### Handoffs (Edges)

Handoffs connect two agents. They determine when and how one agent passes the workflow to another.

- **Designer-Routed:** You manually define the next agent and conditions.
- **AI-Routed:** The system dynamically selects which agent should act next.

You can label each edge to describe its purpose, e.g. _“handoff if data_ready = true”_.

**Pro Tip:**

Use handoffs to modularize responsibilities — one agent can summarize, another can analyze, another can take action.

### AgentSpace Controls

Located at the top-right of the canvas, the toolbar helps you manage workflow design.

| Control                   | Description                                    |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Zoom & Pan**            | Navigate the canvas for large workflows.       |
| **Run Test**              | Simulate the current AgentSpace configuration. |
| **Save Draft**            | Save as a work-in-progress version.            |
| **Promote to Production** | Lock a version for live use.                   |
| **Duplicate**             | Clone a tested workflow for new experiments.   |

## Workflow Management

### Versioning

Every AgentSpace can exist as multiple versions:

- **Drafts** for experimentation
- **Production** for stable, published flows

Version states are visible in the top toolbar.

You can always revert to a previous production version.

### Credit Tracking

Each tool call within an AgentSpace consumes credits.

Credit cost is visible in the **Trace Explorer** after each conversation.

## Orchestrating Multi-Agent Flows

Use the AgentSpace to coordinate **multi-step reasoning and action pipelines**.

Each agent is autonomous but can collaborate through handoffs and shared context.

Example structure:

1. **Collector Agent** — gathers data from a File Search tool.
2. **Analyzer Agent** — runs computations via Code Interpreter.
3. **Summarizer Agent** — crafts a structured response for the user.

## Testing and Debugging

Before deploying:

- Use **Run Test** inside the AgentSpace.
- Inspect outputs in the **Trace Explorer** tab.
- Watch how agents hand off tasks and call tools.

**Checklist before publishing:**

- ✅ Agents produce structured JSON outputs.
- ✅ Handoffs trigger as expected.
- ✅ Tool calls succeed without timeouts.
- ✅ No infinite loops between agents.

## Best Practices for AgentSpace Design

- **Name your agents clearly** — e.g., “Researcher,” “Summarizer,” “Validator.”
- **Keep workflows modular** — isolate specialized logic per agent.
- **Label handoffs** for transparency.
- **Test incrementally** — debug one segment before connecting all agents.
- **Use minimal tools** per agent — this reduces cost and improves clarity.
