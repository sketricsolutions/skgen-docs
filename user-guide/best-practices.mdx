### 1. Clarify Your Agent’s Purpose
- Identify the main tasks or questions your agent will handle (e.g., answering FAQs, guiding users through a process).
- Keep the scope focused to ensure quick, accurate responses.
### 2. Prepare Your Content
- Gather all relevant resources (website pages, PDF manuals, FAQ lists) into one place.
- Organize content by category or topic so your agent can find answers more easily.
### 3. Write Clear Prompts
- Give your agent a concise, friendly introduction
  > e.g., “You are a helpful and friendly support agent for a fitness company. You help users understand our services, guide them through the platform, and answer questions politely and clearly.”
- Use simple, direct language to set expectations
  > e.g., “I’m sorry, I don’t have that information right now. Check our help center at help.example.com or email support@example.com.”
### 4. Keep Knowledge Up-to-Date
- Regularly review and update your source documents, especially FAQs or policy pages.
- Schedule periodic checks (monthly or quarterly) to add new content or remove outdated information.
### 5. Provide Fallback Guidance
- Decide what your agent should say when it cannot find an answer
  > e.g., “I’m not sure, please contact support at support@example.com.”
- Include links to helpful pages or contact channels.
### 6. Test with Real Users
- Share a draft version with a small group of customers or team members.
- Collect feedback on answer accuracy, tone, and clarity.
- Use this feedback to refine prompts and update content.
### 7. Monitor Performance Metrics
- Track simple metrics like number of answered questions, common unanswered topics, and user ratings.
- Use ‘conversations history’ in dashboard to spot trends and improve your agent over time.
### 8. Keep It User-Friendly
- Maintain a polite, helpful tone in all responses.
- Avoid jargon, write in the same style you’d use in customer emails.
### 9. Plan for Growth
- As new features or products launch, update your agent’s content and prompts accordingly.
- Consider gradually adding automation (e.g., form submissions or basic transactions) once your conversational foundation is solid.
