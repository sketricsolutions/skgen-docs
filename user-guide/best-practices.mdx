# Best Practices

Follow these tips to get the best performance out of your SketricGen AI agents.

### 1. Write Clear and Specific Instructions

Your agent’s behavior depends on how you describe its role. Use the **Agent Instructions** section to guide its tone, persona, and responsibilities.

Here’s a great starting point for a friendly support agent:

> “You are a helpful and friendly support agent for a fitness company. You help users understand our services, guide them through the platform, and answer questions politely and clearly.”

You can modify this to suit your business or audience. Try to:

- Be clear about what the agent should and shouldn't do.
- Mention the tone (e.g., formal, casual, enthusiastic).
- Describe the audience it will talk to (e.g., students, customers, employees).

For ease of use, we have added a few role-based ready prompts for you to use, these can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/System-Prompts-1eade0351eaa8040bdb1f0fee91669c9?pvs=21).

### 2. Use Readable and Reliable Content

The quality of your AI depends on the content it learns from. Make sure:

- Uploaded PDFs or text files have selectable, readable text (not scanned images).
- Web pages are accessible (avoid login-restricted or dynamic pages).
- If your content is complex, consider breaking it into smaller files or topics.

Tip: If a website doesn’t load properly as a data source, try copying the content into a text file and uploading that instead.

### 3. Add Helpful Links Correctly

Your AI agent won’t automatically "know" or remember URLs from the content. To make sure it can share useful links:

- Include the link directly in the training text (e.g., “Visit Pricing Page [https://yourdomain.com/pricing]”).
- Use a document or section mapping page titles to their URLs.
- Avoid vague mentions like “click here” without the link attached.

This will also help reduce the chances of the AI inventing incorrect or broken links.

### 4. Choose the Right Model for the Job

SketricGen supports multiple AI models. Here's how to pick one:

| Use Case | Recommended Models |
| --- | --- |
| Customer Support |  |
| Sales Agent | Claude Sonnet, GPT-4 Turbo |
| Product Recommendations | Command-R, GPT-4 Turbo |
| Technical Queries & Research | GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro |

Test and switch models as needed. You can update the agent model anytime from the settings.

### 5. Keep Improving Your Agent

- Try asking it different questions in the **Playground**.
- If answers are unclear or inaccurate, review the data sources and instructions.
- Update your documents and retrain the agent as your content grows.
- Monitor chats through the **Dashboard** to understand common queries and improve the experience.
