Once your agent is created, you'll land in the **Playground** where you can test your agent and talk to it like your customers would. Think of the playground as your interactive testing and preview space.

Hereâ€™s what you can do in the Playground:

- Chat with your agent in real-time  
- See how it responds based on your data and instructions  
- Make quick adjustments before going live  
- Access sharing, retraining, and publishing options in one place
