# Creating Your First AI Agent

Creating your own AI assistant with SketricGen is simple and takes just a few minutes. Follow this step-by-step guide to get started:

### Step 1: Make sure you are signed up and logged in

- Head to [SketricGen.ai](https://sketricgen.ai/) and create an account using your email.
- Log in to access your personalized dashboard.

### Step 2: Open the Agent Creation Wizard

- On your **Dashboard**, click **‚ÄúCreate Agent‚Äù**.
- You‚Äôll enter a 2-step wizard to configure your agent.

### Step 3: Fill Out Basic Information

- **Agent Name**: Choose a friendly or descriptive name (e.g., ‚ÄúSketricGen Customer Support Agent‚Äù).
- **Instructions (***This is the most important step!*):
    
    The **Instructions** field is where you define your AI agent's core behavior. This is essentially the **prompt** that will be sent to the AI model. It acts like the agent‚Äôs personality, job description, and style guide ‚Äî all rolled into one.
    
    #### What Makes Good Instructions?
    
    Think of the Instructions as telling your AI agent:
    
    - Who they are
    - What their role is
    - What tone they should use
    - What type of questions they can (or can‚Äôt) answer
    - What to do when they don‚Äôt know something
    
    Clear, focused instructions lead to better and more consistent answers.
    
    Example:
    
    > ‚ÄúYou are a polite, friendly customer support assistant for an online bookstore. You help users track orders, understand shipping options, and find books based on their preferences. Never speculate, and suggest contacting human support for complex issues.‚Äù
    
    #### Preset Prompts (Use as-is or Customize!)
    
    SketricGen offers **ready-made templates** for common roles to make setup easier. These are available in a dropdown while creating your agent. You can preview and use them directly, or edit them to suit your brand:
    
    - **Customer Support Agent** ‚Äì Friendly, empathetic assistant for resolving user problems and clarifying how your product works.
    - **Sales Agent** ‚Äì Conversational and approachable bot that helps users explore offerings and gently guides them to purchase decisions.
    - **Coding Assistant** ‚Äì Technical AI for developers; offers code suggestions, debugging tips, and real-time collaboration (great for internal tools).
    - **Healthcare Info Bot** ‚Äì Calm and factual assistant to share public health guidance (never diagnostic or advisory).
    - **Mental Health Awareness Guide** ‚Äì Supportive, non-clinical resource for topics like stress and mindfulness.
    - **Productivity Coach** ‚Äì Encouraging and practical coach for goal setting and time management tips.
    - **Legal Literacy Assistant** ‚Äì Educational bot that explains legal terms and helps users understand basic legal structures (not a substitute for legal advice).
    
    #### Tips for Writing Your Own Instructions
    
    If you prefer to start from scratch, keep these tips in mind:
    
    - **Be specific** about the assistant‚Äôs role: support, sales, education, internal guide, etc.
    - **Define the tone**: Should it be friendly? Formal? Casual?
    - **Include limitations**: Tell the bot what not to do (e.g., no guessing, no personal advice).
    - **Encourage fallback responses**: Suggest what the AI should say when unsure (e.g., ‚ÄúLet me check with a teammate and get back to you.‚Äù).

### Step 4: Add Data Sources

This is where your AI agent **learns what it needs to know**. The information you provide here forms the **knowledge base** ‚Äî a private pool of content that your agent will reference when answering user queries. The better your data, the more helpful and accurate your agent will be.

You can add data in the following formats:

#### a. Files (PDF, DOCX, TXT)

Files are often the **most important** source of information for your agent. These may include:

- Company brochures or internal documents
- Product manuals or service guides
- Design guidelines, brand kits, or UI/UX docs
- Research papers, whitepapers, or market studies
- Business proposals or onboarding handbooks
- API documentation or technical references

üëâ Tip: Make sure the text in your files is **readable** ‚Äî if the document is scanned or image-based (e.g., scanned PDFs), it may not extract properly. You can always copy and paste such text into the ‚ÄúRaw Text‚Äù section instead.

#### b. Raw Text (Manual Input)

Use this to quickly add any content **on the spot** that you don't have in a file:

- Temporary instructions
- Special announcements
- Event-specific info
- Notes about new updates, pricing, or changes

You can type or paste plain text directly. This is a great option for adding quick references without having to prepare a document.

#### c. Website Links (Web Scraping)

Want your agent to learn from your website? Just paste the URL ‚Äî SketricGen will **scrape the content** and add it to your knowledge base.

We use **deep web scraping**, which means we crawl through all the relevant pages and child links of the website to gather information. However, two important things to keep in mind:

1. **Time Limits**
    
    Your account type may have a time cap for scraping. Once that time is reached, scraping will stop ‚Äî but everything scraped up to that point will still be added. You can always upgrade your account to buy more scrapping power.
    
2. **Link Depth Limits**
    
    If the scraper finishes going through all available internal links, it stops. This simply means there's no more accessible content to extract.
    
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**: Some websites (especially modern ones using JavaScript widgets or interactive frameworks) may not expose all content clearly. In such cases:

- Pricing widgets
- Tabs or sliders
- Pop-up descriptions or dynamic elements

‚Ä¶ may be missed by the scraper.

To ensure **critical information** is captured, we recommend uploading it as a document (PDF or text) instead. For example:

- Paste pricing tables, product descriptions, and key features into a text file.
- Upload design mockups, schemas, or feature breakdowns.

This ensures your agent can always access what matters most.

#### d. Q&A Pairs (Manual or Pre-Defined FAQs)

If you want your AI agent to respond to questions with **very specific, pre-approved answers**, this is the best option.

You can enter:

- Company FAQs
- Product-specific Q&A
- Interview or onboarding scripts
- Standard support replies

Each entry includes a **Question** and a **Precise Answer**. Your agent will use these to respond exactly as instructed ‚Äî perfect for ensuring accurate replies to common queries.

**Pro Tip**: You can combine all data types for the same agent. For example, upload a user guide, scrape your website, and then add a few Q&As to round it off. The more well-structured and diverse your data, the more confident and helpful your AI agent will be.

### Step 5: Finalize and Create

- Click **‚ÄúCreate Agent‚Äù**.
- SketricGen will process your inputs and build your AI assistant.
- You‚Äôll be redirected to the **Playground** to test it out!
