    Integrating WhatsApp with SketricGen enables your custom workflow to engage directly with customers through WhatsApp, offering a streamlined and efficient solution for managing inquiries and automating responses. This guide will take you through the steps required to link your workflow to a WhatsApp number, ensuring smooth and effective customer communication.

    ## **Before You Begin**

    The phone number you connect to SketricGen via WhatsApp can **only** be used by the workflow. It will no longer work with the WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business apps.

    If the number is already in use, you’ll need to delete the associated WhatsApp account first:

    - Open the **WhatsApp** or **WhatsApp Business** app.
    - Go to **Settings > Account**.
    - Tap **Delete my account**. This process may take a few minutes.

    If you've previously connected the number using Meta's WhatsApp Business tools, make sure to **disable two-step verification**:

    - Log in to your [**WhatsApp Business Account**](https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/home/).
    - Select the phone number you want to integrate.
    - Go to **Settings > Two-step verification**, then turn it off.


    ## **Pre-requisite: Sign Into SketricGen and Set Up Your workflow**

    To get started with the integration, **[sign in to your SketricGen account](https://app.sketricgen.ai)**. If you don’t have an account yet, you can create one for **[free](https://app.sketricgen.ai)**. Once you're logged in, begin setting up your workflow by uploading your data sources. These can include files, text snippets, websites, or Q&A pairs, which will serve as the knowledge base for your workflow.
