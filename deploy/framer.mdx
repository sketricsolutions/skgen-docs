This guide walks you through integrating your SketricGen agent workflow with your Framer website using the chat widget embed code.

## Step 1: Create Your SketricGen Account

To get started with the integration, [sign in to your SketricGen account](https://app.sketricgen.ai). If you don't have an account yet, you can [create one for free](https://app.sketricgen.ai/signup). 

Once you're logged in, begin setting up your agent workflow by uploading your data sources. These can include files, text snippets, websites, or Q&A pairs, which will serve as the knowledge base for your agent workflow.
