  ## **Step 1: Create your SketricGen account**

  To get started with the integration, **[sign in to your SketricGen account](https://app.sketricgen.ai)**. If you don't have an account yet, you can create one for **[free](https://app.sketricgen.ai)**. Once you're logged in, begin setting up your workflow by uploading your data sources. These can include files, text snippets, websites, or Q&A pairs, which will serve as the knowledge base for your workflow.

  If you need assistance with setting up a working SketricGen workflow, refer to the **[step-by-step guide](https://docs.sketricgen.ai/getting-started/quickstart)** for creating and deploying your workflow.

  ## **Step 2: Copy the SketricGen workflow Embed Code**

  After configuring your workflow, go to the dashboard and click **Publish** to copy the embed code. The code will look similar to this:

  ```html
  <script src="https://jswidget.sketricgen.ai/widget-embed.js" data-agent-id="YOUR_AGENT_ID"></script>
  ```

  > **Note:** Make sure your workflow is set to **Public** to embed it on your website.

  ## **Step 3: Add the embed code to your website**
  
  If you have direct access to your website's files:

  1. Open the file where you want to add the workflow (typically index.html, .astro, .jsx, or your template file)
  2. Add the embed code in the `<head>` section of your document
  3. Save the file and upload it to your web server

  > **For multi-page websites:** Adding the script to the `<head>` section of your base template or layout file ensures the chat bubble appears consistently across all pages of your website, giving visitors a seamless experience.

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <!-- Your existing head content -->
      
      <!-- SketricGen Widget Script - Best placed in the head for consistent appearance across pages -->
      <script src="https://jswidget.sketricgen.ai/widget-embed.js" data-agent-id="YOUR_AGENT_ID"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <!-- Your website content -->
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

  ## **Step 4: Test your workflow**

  After adding the embed code:

  1. Preview or publish your website
  2. Verify that the chat bubble appears (typically in the bottom right corner)
  3. Test the workflow by clicking on the bubble and asking a question
