## What is SketricGen?

SketricGen is a drag-and-drop AgentSpace for designing, testing, and deploying multi-agent workflows without touching framework code.

Build a collaborative team of agents, attach tools, define handoffs, validate structured JSON outputs, and deploy instantly via widget or API.

### Why SketricGen?

- **Design, don’t hard-code.** Orchestrate a team of agents visually instead of writing fragile automation scripts.
- **Full control.** Manage logic, handoffs, structured inputs/outputs, and traces - all in one workspace.
- **Ship fast.** Configure a branded widget inside the UI or integrate directly through the public API.
