**Goal:** Build a simple **Triage → Responder** workflow, attach **File Search**, add a **handoff**, test it, and configure a branded widget — all in the UI.

### 1) Create a new AgentSpace (≈30s)

1. Go to **AgentSpaces → New → Blank** (or choose a template).
2. Name it: **Support Assist v1** → **Create**.

> [Screenshot Placeholder]: “Create AgentSpace” dialog.

### 2) Add two agents (≈60s)

- **Agent A — Triage**
  - _Instructions (example):_ “Classify user intent. If product info is needed, handoff to Responder.”
- **Agent B — Responder**
  - _Instructions (example):_ “Use the tool to find relevant docs and produce a concise answer with sources.”

### 3) Attach a tool to Responder (≈45s)

1. Select **Responder → Tools → Add Tool**.
2. Choose **File Search**.
3. Upload PDFs/Docs or select **Crawler** to index a documentation URL.

### 4) Wire the handoff (≈30s)

- Draw a connection **Triage → Responder**.
- Condition: “When info lookup is required” (or leave AI-routed default).

### 5) (Optional) Structured output (≈30s)

- In **Responder → Output → Schema**, define:

```json
{
	"answer": "string",
	"sources": ["string"]
}
```

This ensures predictable **JSON** your app can render and store.

### 6) Test and inspect traces (≈45s)

- Click **Test** and ask: “How do I reset my password?”
- Open **Trace Explorer** to view: called agent, tool input, tool output, **duration**, and **credits used**.

> [GIF Placeholder]: Test panel + Trace Explorer with steps expanded.

### 7) Configure a branded widget (≈60s)

- In the **UI**, open **Deploy → Widget**:
  - Upload **logo**, set **brand colors**, add **default text**, **callouts**, or **initial prompts**.
  - Copy the install snippet or follow the CMS instructions (WordPress, Wix, etc.).
  - (Public API is also available if you prefer server-side invocation; see **Deploy** docs.)

**You’re done.** You’ve designed a working **agentic workflow**, validated it with **traces**, and readied a **widget** for your site. For API or channel deployments (WhatsApp, Wix, WordPress, …), see **Deploy**.
