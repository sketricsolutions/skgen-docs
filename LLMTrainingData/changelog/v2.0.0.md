**Release Date:** _08 October 2025_

SketricGen v2.0.0 marks the platform’s most significant evolution to date — transforming it from a **single-agent builder** into a **multi-agent orchestration and deployment platform**.

This release introduces **AgentSpace**, a visual canvas that lets users design complex workflows of interconnected agents, tools, and triggers — all within a no-code environment.

### Overview

Version 2.0 reimagines how users build and manage AI agents. Instead of one isolated assistant, users can now design **entire agentic systems** — where multiple agents collaborate, exchange data, and perform specialized tasks through dynamic orchestration.

### New Core Features

### 1. AgentSpace (Canvas)

A new visual workspace where users can:

- Create multi-agent workflows with connected nodes.
- Add **Agents**, **Tools**, **Triggers**, and **Handoffs** using a drag-and-drop interface.
- Manage versions, promote drafts to production, and test directly from the canvas.
- Import or export configurations as JSON for version control and reuse.

### 2. Agents & Orchestration

- Agents can now collaborate using **handoffs** or operate as **Agent-as-Tool** within other agents’ workflows.
- Introduced **AI-routed orchestration**, where agents decide when to pass control based on their instructions and input context.
- Added support for **Structured Inputs and Outputs** (typed JSON) to standardize communication between agents.
- Users can define schemas directly in the UI — no coding required.

### 3. Tool Nodes & Extended Capabilities

Agents can now call external services or perform computations via **Tool Nodes**, which include:

- **Sketric App Marketplace:** Connect 2000+ apps (e.g., Gmail, Slack, Google Drive) through OAuth or API keys.
- **File Search:** Build knowledge bases using uploaded files, crawled websites, raw text, or Q&A pairs.
- **Web Search:** Allow agents to retrieve live information from the web.
- **Code Interpreter:** Run Python scripts for computation, file generation, or analysis.
- **API Request:** Configure custom API endpoints with name, method, URL, and headers.
- **Custom MCP:** Connect to Model Context Protocol servers for advanced interoperability.

### 4. Conversations & Traces

- The **Conversations tab** now provides full trace visibility — users can inspect every message, agent decision, and tool call associated with each conversation.
- The **Trace Explorer** remains integrated with AgentSpace for in-depth debugging at the workflow level.
- Traces display agent interactions, structured inputs/outputs, credit usage, and tool performance in real time.

### 5. Insights Dashboard

The **Insights tab** continues to track and visualize usage analytics for agents and workflows.

It includes:

- Conversation counts and traffic metrics
- Credit consumption trends
- Agent performance summaries and improvement patterns

### 6. Deployment & Integrations

Expanded deployment options now allow users to publish multi-agent workflows directly to:

- Websites (via JavaScript or iframe)
- Third-party platforms such as **Slack**, **WhatsApp**, **Zapier**, **Wix**, **WordPress**, **Squarespace**, and **Shopify**
- Public APIs using the new **/run-workflow** endpoint for real-time orchestration

### Additional Enhancements

- **AI-powered Prompt Assistant:** “Improve your Instructions with AI” automatically refines agent prompts using best practices, with optional Edit Mode for manual adjustments.
- **Configuration Management:** Users can now download, import, and duplicate full workflow setups as JSON configurations.
- **Manage Tools Sidebar:** A new control panel to view, edit, and delete connected knowledge bases or third-party app integrations.
- **UI/UX Enhancements:** Added zoom, pan, auto-layout, undo/redo, and workflow fit view options for improved design experience.

### Summary

SketricGen v2.0.0 represents the transition from a simple AI assistant builder to a **full-featured agentic automation platform**.

With multi-agent orchestration, tool integration, structured data handling, detailed traces, and enhanced analytics — users can now design intelligent, scalable systems that move beyond single-agent interaction into full workflow automation.
