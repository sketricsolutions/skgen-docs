Integrating **WhatsApp** with **SketricGen** enables your custom chatbot to engage directly with customers through WhatsApp, offering a streamlined and efficient solution for managing inquiries and automating responses. This guide walks you through linking your chatbot to a WhatsApp number for smooth, effective communication.

## **Before You Begin**

The phone number you connect to SketricGen via WhatsApp can **only** be used by the chatbot. It will no longer work with the WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business apps.

If the number is already in use, you’ll need to delete the associated WhatsApp account first:

- Open the **WhatsApp** or **WhatsApp Business** app.
- Go to **Settings > Account**.
- Tap **Delete my account**. This process may take a few minutes.

If you've previously connected the number using Meta's WhatsApp Business tools, make sure to **disable two-step verification**:

- Log in to your [**WhatsApp Business Account**](https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/home/).
- Select the phone number you want to integrate.
- Go to **Settings > Two-step verification**, then turn it off.


## **Step 1: Sign Into SketricGen and Set Up Your Chatbot**

To get started with the integration, **[sign in to your SketricGen account](https://app.sketricgen.ai)**. If you don’t have an account yet, you can create one for **[free](https://app.sketricgen.ai)**. Once you're logged in, begin setting up your chatbot by uploading your data sources. These can include files, text snippets, websites, or Q&A pairs, which will serve as the knowledge base for your chatbot.
