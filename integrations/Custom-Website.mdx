  ## **Step 1: Create your SketricGen account**

  To get started with the integration, **[sign in to your SketricGen account](https://app.sketricgen.ai)**. If you don't have an account yet, you can create one for **[free](https://app.sketricgen.ai)**. Once you're logged in, begin setting up your chatbot by uploading your data sources. These can include files, text snippets, websites, or Q&A pairs, which will serve as the knowledge base for your chatbot.

  If you need assistance with setting up a working SketricGen chatbot, refer to the **[step-by-step guide](https://docs.sketricgen.ai/user-guide/creating-your-first-agent)** for creating and deploying your chatbot.

  ## **Step 2: Copy the SketricGen Chatbot Embed Code**

  After configuring your chatbot, go to the dashboard and click **Publish** to copy the embed code. The code will look similar to this:

  ```html
  <script src="https://jswidget.sketricgen.ai/widget-embed.js" data-agent-id="YOUR_AGENT_ID"></script>
  ```

  > **Note:** Make sure your chatbot is set to **Public** to embed it on your website.

  ## **Step 3: Add the embed code to your website**
  
  If you have direct access to your website's files:

  2. Paste the embed code just before the closing `</body>` tag

      <!-- Your website content -->
      
      <!-- SketricGen Widget Script - Place just before closing body tag -->
      <script src="https://jswidget.sketricgen.ai/widget-embed.js" data-agent-id="YOUR_AGENT_ID"></script>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```
