## **Step 1: Sign Into SketricGen and Set Up Your Chatbot**

To get started with the integration, [**sign in to your SketricGen account**](https://app.sketricgen.ai/). If you don’t have an account yet, you can create one for [**free**](https://app.sketricgen.ai/). Once you’re logged in, begin setting up your chatbot by uploading your data sources. These can include files, text snippets, websites, or Q&A pairs, which will serve as the knowledge base for your chatbot.

If you need assistance with setting up a working SketricGen chatbot, refer to the [**step-by-step guide**](https://docs.sketricgen.ai/user-guide/creating-your-first-agent) for creating and deploying your chatbot.

## **Step 2: Copy your SketricGen User ID and API Key**

## **Step 5: Configure your integration**

You can now add triggers and more actions in your Zap Workflow with your SketricGen integration by adding a Prompt Message and your Agent ID. You can also add a Conversation ID which will enable your agent to maintain context for multi-turn runs of your workflow. 

Your integration will always return a Response Text which you can further use to generate automated replies, generate leads and much more.
