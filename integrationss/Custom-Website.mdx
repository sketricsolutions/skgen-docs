Integrate SketricGen with any custom website in just a few steps! You can use either a simple JavaScript snippet or an iframe, depending on your needs. This guide will walk you through both methods with clear examples and screenshots.

## 1. JavaScript Embed (Recommended)

Add a chat widget to your website by placing a single script tag in your site's `<head>` section. This is the easiest and most flexible way to get started.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Copy the Script**

<Snippet language="html">
<script src="https://jswidget.sketricgen.ai/widget-embed.js" data-agent-id="asst_your_agent_id"></script>
</Snippet>

2. **Paste into the `<head>` Section**

Open your website's HTML file and locate the `<head>` section. Paste the script anywhere inside it. For example:

<Snippet language="html">
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website</title>
    {/* SketricGen Chat Widget */}
    <script src="https://jswidget.sketricgen.ai/widget-embed.js" data-agent-id="asst_your_agent_id"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    {/* Your website content */}
  </body>
</html>
</Snippet>

> **Tip:** Replace `asst_your_agent_id` with your actual agent ID from the SketricGen dashboard.

### What Happens Next?
- The chat widget will appear on every page where the script is included.
- You can customize the widget’s appearance and behavior from your SketricGen dashboard.

## 2. Manual iFrame Integration

If you want to embed the agent as a full-page or section widget, use the iframe method. This is perfect for help centers, support pages, or dedicated chat areas.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Copy the iFrame Code**

<Snippet language="html">
<iframe src="https://app.sketricgen.ai/iframe-widget/asst_your_agent_id" width="100%" height="700px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</Snippet>

2. **Paste Where You Want the Chat to Appear**

Add the iframe code to any part of your HTML where you want the chat interface to show up. For example, inside a `<div>` on your support page:

<Snippet language="html">
<div class="support-chat">
  <iframe src="https://app.sketricgen.ai/iframe-widget/asst_your_agent_id" width="100%" height="700px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>
</Snippet>

> **Tip:** You can adjust the `height` and `width` as needed to fit your layout.
